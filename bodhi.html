                        The Bodhi Tree or Bodhi Fig Tree ("tree of awakening" -- also called the Bo Tree -- 
                        was a large and ancient sacred fig tree (Ficus religiosa located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India. 
                        Siddhartha Gautama, the spiritual teacher who became known as the Buddha, is said to have attained 
                        enlightenment or Bodhi circa 500 BCE under it. In religious iconography, the Bodhi Tree is 
                        recognizable by its heart-shaped leaves, which are usually prominently displayed.
                        The proper term "Bodhi Tree" is also applied to existing sacred fig (Ficus religiosa) trees, 
                        also known as bodhi trees.[5] The foremost example of an existing tree is the Mahabodhi Tree 
                        growing at the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, which is often cited as a direct descendant of 
                        the original tree. This tree, planted around 250 BCE, is a frequent destination for pilgrims, 
                        being the most important of the four main Buddhist pilgrimage sites.
                        Other holy bodhi trees with great significance in the history of Buddhism are the Anandabodhi 
                        Tree at Jetavana in Sravasti in North India and the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. 
                        Both are also believed to have been propagated from the original Bodhi Tree.
                        On December 8, Bodhi Day celebrates Buddha's enlightenment underneath the Bodhi Tree. 
                        Those who follow the Dharma[dubious – discuss] greet each other by saying, “Budu saranai!
                        ” which translates to "may the peace of the Buddha be yours.” 
                        It is also generally seen as a religious holiday, much like Christmas in the Christian west, 
                        in which special meals are served, especially cookies shaped like hearts (referencing the heart-shaped leaves of the Bodhi) 
                        and a meal of kheer, the Buddha's first meal ending his six-year asceticism.
