                         with the Phalgu River on its eastern side.Gaya is sanctified in the Jain, Hindu, and Buddhist religions. 
                         Gaya district is mentioned in the great epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. 
                         It is the place where Rama, with Sita and Lakshmana, came to offer pind-daan for their father, Dasharath,
                          and continues to be a major Hindu pilgrimage site for the pind-daan ritual.

                         the Kikata kingdom from rigvedic period was located at Gaya, Bihar.
                         Gaya is an ancient city, with a Buddhist documented history dating back to the 6th century BCE 
                         when the sage Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, 16 km (9.9 mi) from the modern city, 
                         and became the Buddha.

                         The fame of ancient Gaya derived from the account in the Ramayana of the god Rama coming 
                         here to the banks of Phalgu River (called the Niranjana), accompanied by his wife and younger brother, 
                         to offer pind-daan for their father Dasharatha,
                          for the moksha of his soul. In the Mahabharata, Gaya is referred to as Gayapuri.
